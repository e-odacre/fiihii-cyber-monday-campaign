# Fiihii – Full Cyber Monday Email Campaign

A strategy-driven, 5-email Cyber Monday campaign built for **Fiihii**, a functional smoothie brand focused on gut health.  
This project showcases end-to-end email marketing execution: **strategy, copywriting, design, and production-ready MJML/HTML development**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this campaign was to maximize Cyber Monday revenue while maintaining list health and deliverability.  
The sequence was intentionally structured to move subscribers through **anticipation → value → urgency → final extension**.

The deliverables include five mobile-first email templates designed in Figma, coded in MJML, and exported as production-ready HTML compatible with Klaviyo and Mailchimp.

## 🧠 Campaign Strategy & Send Plan

### **Email 1 — Teaser (Sunday Evening)**
- Built anticipation ahead of Cyber Monday
- Used to segment **high-intent subscribers** based on opens and clicks

### **Email 2 — Launch (Monday Morning)**
- Sent only to teaser-engaged contacts
- Suppression strategy to protect deliverability and prioritize engaged users
- Introduced the core Cyber Monday offer

### **Email 3 — Hard Push (Monday Afternoon)**
- Timed for prime inbox window (1–3 PM)
- Reinforced urgency and value with repeated CTAs

### **Email 4 — Last Call (Monday Evening)**
- Sent 4–5 hours before midnight
- Targeted non-purchasers with the strongest incentives (bundles, subscriptions, guarantees)

### **Email 5 — Extension (Tuesday Morning)**
- Framed as a customer-requested **12-hour extension**
- Captured additional revenue without diluting the original deadline
